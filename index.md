# Arrive at seven the place feels good #
## No time to call you today ##
### Encores till seven then Chinese food ###
#### Back to the hotel again ####

##### I call your number the line ain't free ####
###### I like to tell you come to me ######
A night without you seems like a lost dream
Love I can't tell you how I feel
